Data makes information
Information in digital world is Cyber-Security

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Threats =
	If someone access your info than this someone is threat for you
	It can be person, object or any event

Types:
	Inadvertent  threats (human failuar)
	Physical disasters (natural disasters)
	Technical failures (hardware or software)
	->Deliberate acts (hacking, espionage)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terms=
	CIA Triad:
	[
	Confidentiality: No telling to unthourized person ( Wider than privacy )
	Integrity: Completeness and accuracy of data
	Availability: When needed, data is available
	]                                                                          
	Non-repudiation: Acceptance for both parties about reciving and sending
	Authenticity: You should actual be who authorized for data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"THE QUIETER YOU BECOME, THE MORE YOU ARE ABLE TO HEAR"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INFORMATION WARFARE =
	Stealing info of group of people or enemy for special porpose or advantage
CYBER WARFARE=
	Same as info warfare but digitally

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability: Weakness that can be exploited
Threat: One who exploit vulnerability
Risk: Damage cause by exploting vulnerability
Asset: Which need to be accessed after explotation
Bug: Error, fault or flaw that may cause unexpected error
Hacker: Gain acces with or without malicious intent
Cracker: Gain access to harm asset, always malicious
InfoSec: Information Security/ Cyber security/ Data security
Penetration Testing: Testing and Reporting the security loopholes
Vulnerability Assessment: Testing and Repoting loopholes, and tells how to fix
VAPT: VA (How to gain access and dive into target), PT (How deeply we can dive and find weakness)
Cyber Espionage: Spying on someone to gain confidantial info about them
Exploits: Attacker designed to cause unexpected behaviour to gain advantage
Script Kiddie: Noob hacking without any skill
Zero-Day: Vulnerability not known by professionals, only known by hacker

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5 Phase of EH =

Footprinting: Gaining as much information about the target, like open ports, network info, personal info, social info, system info etc...

Scanning: Finding loopholes and vulnerabilities in the information that we are gathered, like login vulnerability etc...

Gaining access/ Exploitation: Exploit the vulnerabilities with tools and techniques

Mintaining access/ Backdoor creation: Creating and deploying backdoor (Hidden way for entering into system and gain access for long time) for persistence

Clearing logs: Removing traces and records (that we are created when enterd) to avoid being caught

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Penetration Testing=
	Authorized simulated cyber attack on a system
	Its done for check system immunity and capacity
	Perticular domain knowledge is importante
	EH is learning, but PT is implementation

7 Phase of PT =
	
Pre Engagement: Meeting with client for clear their vision and needs

Planning/ Recon/ Footprinting: Gather all info for scan

Threat modelling and Vulnerability identification: Create model of all security concerns and ranking all vulnerability from high risk to low

Explotation: Find bug or Breaching system by vulnerability

Post Explotation: Same as Maintain attack and attack 2nd time with the help of first attack and continue...

Reporting: Detailing the vulnerabilty found and their impact and remedies

Resolution and Re-Testing: Resolve the issue and than re test all vulnarebility
